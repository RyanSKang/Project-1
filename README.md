# Project-1 What's In Your Fridge?
## Description
Welcome to "What's "In Your Fridge!" A simple application that allows users to search for recipes based on the ingredients that are available to them.

Creating What's in Your Fridge was very challenging. We had a lot of trouble understanding fetch and manipulating the URL strings to search for correct data within the API fetch, but this challenge really forced us to navigate our API's to display the data we wanted. The main goal for our application was to utilize our local storage based on user interaction to pull specific data to their likings. It was really neat to create something from scratch with no outline or reference since this was our own original idea we had to make come true. There are alot of improvements needed in our application but we had a great experience on how to work as a team even with obstacles and outside factors affecting our efficiency. It was neat to create functions and passing on to different java script files to execute a smoother web application. This application specifically stores data of ingredients that the User accepts, and with that information we manipulate the ingredients into the API Fetch URL so that it produces a list of results we can make based off the ingredients we choose from. We wanted to build this project to help save money and not waste food in our own household. It was pretty difficult to debug code when everyone works at different times or when there were merge conflicts but it really helped us get into a mindset to break things down one step at a time in order to solve our problem. We were able to produce descriptive comments within our code so we don't get lost in our own work. Moreover, we used a tailwind CSS to style our website.
